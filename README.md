Fit-Track is a **workout application** for **watchOS 11**, built using Swift and the latest version of Xcode on **macOS 15 Sonoma**. It’s designed to track user exercises and repetitions using Apple Watch’s built-in sensors, like the accelerometer and gyroscope, to estimate repetitions for exercises like **bench presses** and **pull-ups**. This app offers a feature-rich experience similar to the onboard Apple Watch exercise app, with an added focus on **repetition tracking**.

## Features

- **Exercise Tracking**: Track popular exercises such as bench presses, pull-ups, and more.
- **Repetition Estimation**: Uses the Apple Watch’s accelerometer and gyroscope to estimate exercise repetitions.
- **Heart Rate Monitoring**: Integrates with Apple Watch’s built-in heart rate monitor to track workout intensity.
- **Custom Workout Options**: Choose from a list of exercises and track your stats for each session.
- **Workout Summary**: View detailed summaries after each session, including total reps, heart rate, and calories burned.
